"""momentum.py — Momentum-burst detector.

A burst is one session that breaks out of a stock's own recent behaviour: a
large single-day advance carried by volume well above its 20-day norm. It is
computed from `daily_ohlc` (real H/L/C bars), so it needs no extra fetch and
adds no write path to `full_run`.

MEASURED before it was built, and re-measured when the thresholds were loosened
(2026-08-17, day-deduped, forward move vs the same-day cohort median,
independence-checked via measure.py):

    >=3.0% & 1.5x   3d  n=42  beat 83.3%  +2.54%  |  7d  n=35  beat 71.4%  +1.92%
    >=2.0% & 1.3x   3d  n=66  beat 80.3%  +2.14%  |  7d  n=53  beat 71.7%  +2.13%

The looser trigger (now the default, for earlier entry) gives up ~3 points of
3-day accuracy but is identical at 7 days with a better median excess, on 57%
more signals. All four cohorts pass independence on both horizons.

Both horizons agree and neither is one sector's rally, which is more than can be
said for most ideas tried on this data (score velocity 45%, OBV divergence
negative, accumulation heuristics no edge).

The stricter variant that ALSO requires a 20-day closing high scored 91.3% at
3 days, but its 7-day sample is 16 rows and 69% one sector — so `at_high` is
carried as a TAG, not part of the trigger. Do not promote it without more data.

This is a WATCH tier, not a signal. It never becomes a Buy: the audit in
CLAUDE.md showed the gate layer selecting the worst subset of a pool that had
edge, so new findings are surfaced, not wired into the score.
