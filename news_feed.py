"""news_feed.py — Reads the authentic news feed produced by the daily Claude
news routine (news_signals.json) and exposes per-symbol verdicts to the engine.

The routine (see news_routine.md) reads real articles from an allowlist of
authentic PSX/financial sources, judges each stock's news, and writes a verdict
WITH source URLs. This module only READS that file — it never fetches news
itself, so the 15-min engine loop stays fast and offline-safe.

Freshness contract: if the file is missing, malformed, or older than
config.NEWS_SIGNALS_MAX_AGE_HOURS, get() returns None for every symbol and the
caller falls back to RSS/VADER scoring. Authentic-but-absent is never faked.

Per-symbol verdict schema (values the engine relies on):
    score        float 0-100  (50 = neutral; >50 positive, <50 negative)
    direction    "positive" | "negative" | "neutral"
    materiality  "normal" | "material_negative" | "material_positive"
    confidence   "high" | "medium" | "low"
    summary      str   one-line plain-English reason
    headlines    list[str]
    sources      list[str]  (URLs — authenticity is traceable, not asserted)
