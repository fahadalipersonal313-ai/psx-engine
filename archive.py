"""archive.py — move settled decision history to a durable file, verifiably.

The tracked database is committed on every 15-minute cycle, so its size is a
per-push cost. `decisions` + `decision_snapshots` are the unbounded part: 0.67 MB
per 60-symbol session, roughly 14 MB a month, against GitHub's 100 MB hard limit.
Compression bought headroom; it did not stop the growth.

These rows are immutable audit records, so they are ARCHIVED, never discarded.
The order is deliberate and is the whole point of the module:

    export  ->  verify  ->  purge

`purge` refuses to delete anything the archive cannot reproduce byte-for-byte.
A restore is not a hope, it is checked before the live rows go away, which is the
"durable destination and a verified restore" the operating constraints ask for.

Snapshots are shared: several decisions can point at one snapshot_hash. A
snapshot is only archived and purged when NO retained decision still references
it, otherwise a live row would be left pointing at nothing.

The archive is a plain SQLite file. It restores with `python main.py restore
<path>` and needs no code from this repo to read -- a format that outlives the
tool is part of being durable.

#       past runs_full_days; what remains is history, and history belongs in a
#       file rather than in every push.
