"""target_timing.py — how long a move of a given size has actually taken.

A target without a timeframe invites the worst habit in swing trading: holding a
dead position indefinitely because the target has not been "hit yet". But an
estimate must not be invented, and the obvious arithmetic — distance divided by
ATR — is wrong in a way that flatters: ATR measures how far a stock TRAVELS in a
day (high minus low), not how far it PROGRESSES, so a 2-ATR target does not take
two sessions. It typically takes many more, and sometimes never arrives.

So this measures it instead. For every historical session of a symbol it asks:
starting here, how many sessions until the high first reached close + k*ATR, and
did it reach it at all inside the horizon? That yields two numbers a card can
state honestly:

    * typical_sessions — the MEDIAN sessions-to-touch among the attempts that
      DID reach the level. Median, not mean, so one 40-session grind does not
      dominate.
    * hit_rate — the share of attempts that reached it within the horizon.

The hit rate is the important half and the half a "target in N days" label
normally hides. A 6-session median at a 45% hit rate is not a forecast that the
target arrives in six sessions; it is "when this worked it took about six, and
it worked under half the time".

Nothing here feeds a signal. It describes a level the technical layer already
chose, and per CLAUDE.md new findings are surfaced, not wired into the score.
